# Police-Shooting-Analysis-Using-R
# Are Body Cameras Being Sufficiently Used To Prevent Fatal Police Shootings?

This R project analyzes 10 years of police shootings data from The Washington Post to explore trends in body camera usage. I identified high-risk departments, performed statistical analysis, and visualized disparities by time and race.

## Key Tools: R, dplyr, ggplot2, t-tests, Shapiro-Wilk
## Key Findings:
- 77% of fatal shootings in high-frequency departments involved no body camera
- Weekly body camera usage rarely exceeded 60%
- Statistically significant age differences were found between body camera and non-body camera incidents
